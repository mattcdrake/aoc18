# AOC18

A simple Node.js app that runs my solutions for the 2018 Advent of Code
solutions from a ~~nice(ish)~~ gross web interface.

Yes, this is unnecessary. I just wanted to try learning some Node.js.

## TODO

- Add react components
- Clean app.js & solution.js
- Refactor GET routes to use a query string
- Split up functions in `solution.js` in a more coherent way
- Add testing
