# AOC18

A simple Node.js app that views my solutions for the 2018 Advent of Code
solutions from a ~~nice(ish)~~ gross web interface.

It's obviously unneccessary to create a full web app to solve the puzzles - a
few Python scripts would be much simpler for hammering out th algorithms.
However, I wanted to try learning JavaScript in depth and a Node.js app seemed
like the perfect way to achieve that.

## TODO

- Break up the monolithic structure of puzzle #7's solution
- Add test suite confirming that old answers don't change
