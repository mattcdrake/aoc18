# AOC18

A simple Node.js app that runs my solutions for the 2018 Advent of Code
solutions from a nice(ish) web interface.

Yes, this is unnecessary. I just wanted to try learning some Node.js.

## TODO

- The actual puzzles, for one
- Write test suite
- Add react components
- Clean app.js & solution.js
